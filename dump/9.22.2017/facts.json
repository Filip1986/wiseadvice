Just like today, December 25th was a day when businesses and public offices closed, and people went to church and exchanged gifts with families. In addition, the ensuing “Twelve Days of Christmas” were more than just a repetitive song. It was an unholy week and a half of drunken debauchery*. During the 12 days, businesses often continued to be closed, and the people celebrated with consecutive days of eating, gift-giving, excessive drinking, partying, music, dancing, gambling and fireworks! It was essentially Christmas, Thanksgiving, St. Patrick’s Day, Mardi Gras, and the Fourth of July all rolled into one. You could expect to see 12 drummers drumming, 11 pipers piping, and 9 ladies dancing (and if you’re lucky, maybe 6 geese a-laying) Naturally, the puritans in Parliament resented this 12-day-long bout of revelry operating under auspices of “Holy Days”, and they were especially concerned with the Catholic origins of the traditional Christmas celebrations. Therefore, they officially outlawed the celebration of Christmas and all other holy days (including Easter). The only holy days that would be observed would be Sundays.

Five years her brother’s senior, Maria Anna progressed very quickly and by the age of 12 she was wowing audiences across much of western Europe with her musical precision and skill! Her days of having the spotlight to herself were short-lived however, as her younger brother Wolfgang soon became engrossed in the family pastime. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had the benefits of a three-year head start on his sister and the fact that he could learn from not only their father, but Maria Anna herself! Those three years likely made a profound difference in Wolfgang’s development, as scientists have found that those who begin lessons before the age of 7 induce more dramatic structural changes in their brain. The siblings toured Europe together for 3 years, stopping in 88 different cities and covering several thousand miles by horse-drawn carriage. Part of the reason we don’t hear much about Mozart’s sister anymore is because her father pulled the plug on her career in 1769, when she was just 18! She stayed home composing her own music while her father and brother toured Italy together, but unfortunately none of her works have been discovered. ", "link" : "http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/maria-anna-mozart-the-familys-first-prodigy-1259016/" },
