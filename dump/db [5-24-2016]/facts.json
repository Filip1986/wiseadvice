The main marketing pitch of Axe is that using it will make extremely attractive girls swarm any guy who uses it. While Dove emphasizes that every woman is beautiful. One attempts to empower women, while the other objectifies them.",

    "en_fact" : "In the 1640s, Parliament banned Christmas. ",
    "detailed" : "In early 17th century England, Christmas was both a holy day and a public holiday. Just like today, December 25th was a day when businesses and public offices closed, and people went to church and exchanged gifts with families. In addition, the ensuing “Twelve Days of Christmas” were more than just a repetitive song. It was an unholy week and a half of drunken debauchery*. During the 12 days, businesses often continued to be closed, and the people celebrated with consecutive days of eating, gift-giving, excessive drinking, partying, music, dancing, gambling and fireworks! It was essentially Christmas, Thanksgiving, St. Patrick’s Day, Mardi Gras, and the Fourth of July all rolled into one. You could expect to see 12 drummers drumming, 11 pipers piping, and 9 ladies dancing (and if you’re lucky, maybe 6 geese a-laying) Naturally, the puritans in Parliament resented this 12-day-long bout of revelry operating under auspices of “Holy Days”, and they were especially concerned with the Catholic origins of the traditional Christmas celebrations. Therefore, they officially outlawed the celebration of Christmas and all other holy days (including Easter). The only holy days that would be observed would be Sundays. This move proved to be very unpopular, and only lasted until 1660 with the Restoration of the monarchy. ",

    "en_fact" : "Your brain cannot feel pain inside itself. ",
    "detailed" : "The human brain contains no pain receptors or sensory system of any kind for that matter. Therefore any changes in temperature, pressure, or even damage to brain tissue would not be detected by your brain unless it affected an area connected to the nervous system. Therefore, when tumors or cysts cause people to experience headaches, the pain is actually resulting from pressure on nerve tissue or blood vessels that surround the brain, not the brain itself. This anatomical quirk has also proven useful in numerous brain surgeries, since a lack of pain often allows patients to remain completely conscious during the entire procedure! In these sorts of situations, patients are able to report any changes in sensation to the surgeon, which allows the surgeon to avoid harming critical brain areas. ",

    "en_fact" : "People retain significantly more material when studying in an unfamiliar font that is hard to read. ",
    "detailed" : "The reason strange fonts serve as a more effective study tool is because they cause us to think harder about the material we read. Oftentimes, the ease with which which we are able to study becomes counterproductive because our brains tend to associate information that is easily perceived as being just as effortless to recall later. To put it differently, when material isn’t challenging to read because it is written in an ordinary font we tend to skim more while reading because visual familiarity demands less mental concentration. ",

    "en_fact" : "Mozart’s older sister was considered to be one of the finest pianists in all of Europe until her brother came along! ",
    "detailed" : "Maria Anna Mozart learned how to play harpsichord at the age of 8 from her father, a court musician. Five years her brother’s senior, Maria Anna progressed very quickly and by the age of 12 she was wowing audiences across much of western Europe with her musical precision and skill! Her days of having the spotlight to herself were short-lived however, as her younger brother Wolfgang soon became engrossed in the family pastime. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had the benefits of a three-year head start on his sister and the fact that he could learn from not only their father, but Maria Anna herself! Those three years likely made a profound difference in Wolfgang’s development, as scientists have found that those who begin lessons before the age of 7 induce more dramatic structural changes in their brain. The siblings toured Europe together for 3 years, stopping in 88 different cities and covering several thousand miles by horse-drawn carriage. Part of the reason we don’t hear much about Mozart’s sister anymore is because her father pulled the plug on her career in 1769, when she was just 18! She stayed home composing her own music while her father and brother toured Italy together, but unfortunately none of her works have been discovered. ",

    "detailed" : "In fact, he considered painting a vastly inferior art form in comparison to sculpture. He thought painting was usually a waste of time, especially oil paintings, which were only \"suitable for women\", and landscapes, which he thought should be forbidden. This is pretty humorous, considering that Michelangelo was commissioned to paint what would become two of the most famous works of art in all of history! His frescoes in the Sistine Chapel (scenes from Genesis on the ceiling and The Last Judgment on the altar wall) are two of the most iconic and influential paintings in the Western world. Not bad for a guy who preferred to work in stone with such creations as the Pietà and David! ",

    "en_fact" : "Banana peels can be used to purify water. ",
    "detailed" : "Compounds in the peels contain nitrogen, sulfur, and organic compounds such as carboxylic acids. These acids contain negatively-charged electron pairs which can attract metals that are commonly found in water, such as lead or copper, because they typically have a positive charge. Researchers in Brazil even found the banana peels to be superior to many synthetic filtration materials developed within the past ten years! Peels are easy to renew, and can be used up to eleven times before wearing out. Do not try this at home yet, though - banana peels have not been proven to extract anything but these sorts of metals from water. Another fun fact - banana peels are great for polishing items such as leather shoes and silver! ",
